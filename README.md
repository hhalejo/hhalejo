## Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I'm a Software Development Technician currently in my 5th semester of a Software Engineering degree.
📍 Based in Pereira, Colombia — always learning, building, and exploring new ways to solve problems with code.
💻 I work with JavaScript, Python, SQL, and backend technologies like Node.js and Express.
🧠 I'm passionate about understanding how things work under the hood. I enjoy working with data structures, relational databases, and applying SOLID principles to write clean, scalable code.
🔍 Currently diving deeper into unit testing, software architecture, and agile methodologies like Scrum.
🌐 I'm interested in both frontend and backend development, aiming to become a full stack developer with strong technical foundations.
⚙️ I enjoy technical challenges, clean code, and that satisfying moment when everything finally makes sense.
☕ And yes, coffee is part of the process.
